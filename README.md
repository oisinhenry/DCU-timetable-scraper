# DCU Timetable Scraper

WIP timetable scraper for DCU. Written in Python 3.


## TODO:

Structure text data parsed from HTML file. (kind of achieved - mostly whitespace seperated now. still need a proper parse function)

Implement timeslot objects (!) and structure timetable in a readable way


## Long term goals:

Output to some format readable by humans. (not just python command line).

Package as a web or React app and implement Google/Apple calendar export functionality.
