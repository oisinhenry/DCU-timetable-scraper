# DCU Timetable Scraper

WIP timetable scraper for DCU. Written in Python 3.


## TODO:

~~Structure text data parsed from HTML file.~~

~~Implement timeslot objects.~~ (this isn't totally finished yet).

Implement a function to iterate through all the text data and create Timeslot objects.

Implement a data structure to store those Timeslot objects in order by day and then by time.

Implement methods to query and print the list(?) of Timeslot objects.


## Long term goals:

Output to some (standardized) format readable by humans (not just python command line).

Package as a web app (React?) and implement Google/Apple calendar export functionality.
